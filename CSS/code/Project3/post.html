        <p>
          <b>1950s-1960s:</b>This era is marked by the development of symbolic
          AI, where researchers focused on creating systems capable of reasoning
          and problem-solving using symbolic manipulation. Early projects during
          this time include the Logic Theorist, General Problem Solver (GPS),
          and the first AI program to play chess. <br />
          <b>1970s-1980s:</b> Symbolic AI faced challenges in dealing with
          uncertainty and complexity, leading to the emergence of new approaches
          such as expert systems and knowledge-based systems. Expert systems
          attempted to encode human knowledge and expertise into rule-based
          systems. <br />
          <b>Late 20th Century:</b> The field of AI experienced periods of both
          optimism and skepticism, known as AI summers and winters,
          respectively. AI winters were characterized by reduced funding and
          interest due to unmet expectations and limited progress. <br />
          <b>1990s-Present:</b> Advances in computing power, algorithms, and
          data availability have led to significant progress in AI. Machine
          learning, particularly deep learning, has revolutionized the field by
          enabling systems to learn from data rather than being explicitly
          programmed. <br />
          <b>21st Century:</b> AI applications have become pervasive across
          various domains, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and
          entertainment. Breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP),
          computer vision, and reinforcement learning have led to the
          development of intelligent systems capable of human-level performance
          in certain tasks.

            <h2 class="h2">The three kinds of AI based on capabilities</h2>
          </div>
        </section>
        <p>
          <b> 1. Artificial Narrow AI Artificial Narrow Intelligence</b>, also
          known as Weak AI, what we refer to as Narrow AI is the only type of AI
          that exists today. Any other form of AI is theoretical. It can be
          trained to perform a single or narrow task, often far faster and
          better than a human mind can. However, it can‚Äôt perform outside of its
          defined task. <br />
          <br />
          <b>2. General AI Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</b>, also known
          as Strong AI, is today nothing more than a theoretical concept. AGI
          can use previous learnings and skills to accomplish new tasks in a
          different context without the need for human beings to train the
          underlying models.  <br /><br />
          <b>3. Super AI Super AI</b> is commonly referred to as artificial
          superintelligence and, like AGI, is strictly theoretical. If ever
          realized, Super AI would think, reason, learn, make judgements and
          possess cognitive abilities that surpass those of human beings. 
        </p>
        <h2>The four types of AI based on functionalities</h2>
        <p>
          <b> 1. Reactive Machine AI:-</b><br />
          Reactive machines are AI systems with no memory and are designed to
          perform a very specific task. Since they can‚Äôt recollect previous
          outcomes or decisions, they only work with presently available data.
          Reactive AI stems from statistical math and can analyze vast amounts
          of data to produce a seemingly intelligence output. <br />
          <b> 2. Limited Memory AI:-</b> <br />
          Unlike Reactive Machine AI, this form of AI can recall past events and
          outcomes and monitor specific objects or situations over time. Limited
          Memory AI can use past- and present-moment data to decide on a course
          of action most likely to help achieve a desired outcome. However,
          while Limited Memory AI can use past data for a specific amount of
          time, it can‚Äôt retain that data in a library of past experiences to
          use over a long-term period.  <br />
          <b>3. Theory of Mind AI:-</b> <br />
          Theory of Mind AI is a functional class of AI that falls underneath
          the General AI. Though an unrealized form of AI today, AI with Theory
          of Mind functionality would understand the thoughts and emotions of
          other entities. This understanding can affect how the AI interacts
          with those around them. In theory, this would allow the AI to simulate
          human-like relationships.  <br />
          <b>4. Self-Aware AI:-</b>
          Self-Aware AI is a kind of functional AI class for applications that
          would possess super AI capabilities. Like theory of mind AI,
          Self-Aware AI is strictly theoretical. If ever achieved, it would have
          the ability to understand its own internal conditions and traits along
          with human emotions and thoughts. It would also have its own set of
          emotions, needs and beliefs.

           <h2>Additional capabilities and practical applications of AI technologies.....</h2>
        </section>
        <p><b>Computer vision:-</b>
          Narrow AI applications with computer vision can be trained to interpret and analyze the visual world. This allows intelligent machines to identify and classify objects within images and video footage. <br>
          
          Applications of computer vision include: <br>
          
          Image recognition and classification <br>
          Object detection <br>
          Object tracking <br>
          Facial recognition <br>
          Content-based image retrieval <br>
          Computer vision is critical for use cases that involve AI machines interacting and traversing the physical world around them. Examples include self-driving cars and machines navigating warehouses and other environments. <br>
          
          <b>Robotics:-</b>
          Robots in industrial settings can use Narrow AI to perform routine, repetitive tasks that involve materials handling, assembly and quality inspections. In healthcare, robots equipped with Narrow AI can assist surgeons in monitoring vitals and detecting potential issues during procedures. Agricultural machines can engage in autonomous pruning, moving, thinning, seeding and spraying. And smart home devices such as the iRobot Roomba can navigate a home‚Äôs interior using computer vision and use data stored in memory to understand its progress. <br>
          
          <b>Expert systems:-</b>
          Expert systems equipped with Narrow AI capabilities can be trained on a corpus to emulate the human decision-making process and apply expertise to solve complex problems. These systems can evaluate vast amounts of data to uncover trends and patterns to make decisions. They can also help businesses predict future events and understand why past events occurred.</p>
