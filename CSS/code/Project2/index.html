        <h2>Who invented Java and why ?</h2>
        <article>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Java is invented by Mr.James Gosling in Sun Microsystems in the
              year 1991,and it is released in the year 1995.The version is
              released only for testing purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
              The first version for project development is released in the year
              1996 as java 1.0.The latest version of java is 22,and it is
              released on March 19<sup>th</sup> 2024.
            </li>
            <li>
              Currently java is with Oracle Corporation.In the year 2010,Oracle
              Corporation acquired java and all other products of Sun
              Microsystems.
            </li>
            <li>
                Java is invented to achieve Platform independency for developing internet based business applications.

        <h2>Types of Applications</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
             In computer world all softwares or projects or applications are basically divided into two types:- <br><br>
             <u><b>(i)Stand-alone Application:-</b></u> <br>
              An application that is installed in one system and if it is accessible only within this system with a local call,and can't be accessible from other systems with a network via internet then we call it as Stand-alone application. A stand-alone application is a single user and single computer application.<br>
              For example:-Calculator,Notepad,Antivirus,MS-office,Game softwares,browser,mobile apps etc.. <br> <br>
             <u><b>(ii)Internet Application:- </b></u><br>
             An application that is installed in one system and if it is accessible from other systems with a network via internet is called as Internet Application.
             An internet application is a multi user and multi computer application. <br>
             For example:-Youtube,Instagram,Facebook,Amazon,Zoom etc...

        <h2>What is Platform,PD,PI ?</h2>
        <article>
          <p><b>Platform:- </b><br>
            A platform is an environment in which programs are loaded and executed and generate output. A platform can be a software only platform or hardware only platform or both. <br>
            <ul>
                <li>The computer  platform is Processor+Hardware devices+OS.</li>
                <li>C and C++ programs platform is OS.C and C++ programs are directly exceuted by OS.</li>
                <li>Java Programs platform is JVM(Java Virtual Machine). Java Programs are excuted by JVM,but not by OS. JVM's platform is OS.The OS executes JVM, JVM executes Java Program. </li>
                <li>Python program's platform is PVM(Python Virtual Machine).Python Programs are executed by PVM,but not by OS. PVM's platform is OS. The OS executes PVM, PVM executed Python Program.</li>
                <li>HTML page platform is browser.</li>
                <li>Audio and Video files platform is media player(vlc).</li>
                <li>.NET program platform is CLR(Common Language Runtime). </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
                <p><b>Platform Dependency:-</b> <br>
                    A program's compiled code of one OS,if it can not be executed in different OS we call it as Platform Dependency.The programming language using which we develop this program is called as <b>Platform Dependent Language.</b> <br>
                    For Example:C and C++ programs
                </p>
                <p><b>Platform Independency:-</b> <br>
                    A program's compiled code of one OS, if it can be executed in different OS we call it as Platform Independency.The Programming language using which we develop this program is called as <b>Platform Independent Language.</b> <br>
                    For example:Java,Python Programs

        <h2>Why C and C++ programs are PD ?</h2>
        <article>
        <p>
            In C and C++ languages programs are compiled targeting to one OS. Hence the compiled code contains ML(Machine Language)of a Particular OS directly.One OS machine language format is not understandable to another OS.Hence the C and C++ programs compiled code can not be executed by other OS.Hence the C and C++ programs are Platform Dependent. <br>
            Not only C program, C software is also platform dependent, because all it's components Compiler, Linker & Library are Platform Dependent.So, we will have separate C software for every OS.

            <p>
                In java,programs are not compiled into Machine Language of a Particular OS.It means in Java,Programs are not compiled targeting to one OS.In java,programs are compiled into one common languages code called <b>byte code</b> then later that byte code is converted into ML of a particular OS by JVM in which it is running.We have to separate JVM for OS for converting the same bytecode into a particular OS ML.

        <article>
            <ul>
                <li>JDK stands for Java Development Kit</li> 
                <li>JDK is the java Software <br>
                It provides :- <br>
               (i)Development Tools <br>
               (ii)Runtime Environment <br>
              (iii)Java Library(API-Application Programming Interface)</li>
                <li>Development tools means small softwares for compiling java program, reading byte code, generating documentation, preparing jar files etc... opeartions performing softwares are called Development Tools.
                <br>
                Runtime Environment means the platform for running java program. The JVM is called Runtime Environment of Java Program for executing java programs. <br>
                Java Library means the predefined classes provided by SUN(Oracle) as part of JDK for reusing and developing our new programs. In java we will calls library as API.
                </li>
                <li>Hence we can say by installing JDK software we will get (compiler,JVM and API) for developing,compiling and executing a java program.</li>
                <li>Downloading and installing JDK22 software:-</li>
                (1)Open browser <br>

                <li>Steps to develop a java program <br>
                a java program development, compilation and execution comes under & steps:-
                (1)Open Notepad <br>
                (2)Type java code/program <br>
                (3)Save this program <br>
                (4)Open cmd prompt software <br>
                (5)Change drive and directory path in cmd prompt to our project drive and directory in which our program is saved.
                (6)Compiler java program by using javac tool.(javac <file name>)
                (7)Execute java byte code by using java tool .(java <class name>)

        <h2>Essential Statements to develop Java</h2>
        <article>
            <p>To develop, compile, execute and display some message in java we have three essential Statements. <br>
            <b>(i)Class :-</b><br>
            Class is essential because, Java is an OOP language so every program must starts with a class. <br>
            <b>(ii)Main method :-</b><br>
            Main method is essential because,main method is the initial point of class logic execution.JVM executes a class starts with main method. If a class doesnot have main method, JVM will not execute it , will throw error. <br>
            <b>(iii)System.out.println(); :-</b> <br>
            System.out.println(); is essential in java. We can display any message on console only by using System.out.println(_);</p>

                Developer defined class is called as User defined class or custom class. <br>
                <b>Predefined class :-</b> <br>
                Already defined class is called as Predefined Class.These class may be developed by SUN Microsystem developers, or some other developers. <br>
                Example:- System,String are predefined classes and FirstProgram,Employee are user defined class.

          <p><b>Comment:-</b> <br>
            A comment is a special syntax.A comment is used for telling to compiler for ignoring some part of the code compilation.The code placed in the comment will not be compiled by compiler,byte code is not generated.
            It means the code placed in the comment will not be available in .class file.

        <h2>How many types of comments Java supports ?</h2>
        <article>
          <p><b>Java Supports 3 types of Comments</b> <br>
           (i)Single Line Comment   (//) <br>
           (ii)Mutli Line Comment   (/*   */) <br>
           (iii)Document Comment    (/** */) <br>
          <b>Single line</b> and <b>Multi line</b> comments are used for commenting programming Statements such as variable, methods, Sopln(),conditions,loops etc...
          <br>
          <b>Document Comment</b> is used for providing description to programming elements such as class, variable, method, constructor, block, inner classes.

        <h2>What is Identifier ?</h2>
        <article>
          <p>A name of a Programming element is technically called as an <b>Identifier.</b>
          A class name, variable name and method name are called as Identifier.

      <section id="Rules in Creating Identifier">
        <h2>Rules in Creating Identifier</h2>
        <article>
          <p><b>(a)Identifier must contain only <br></b>
          (i)letters ->A-Z or a-z  <br>
          (ii)digits ->0-9 <br>
          (iii)special Characters ->only $ and _ <br> <br>
          (b)Identifier can not be started with a digit. We can use a digit only from second character onwards. <br>
          (c)Identifier can not have special Characters except $ and _. <br>
          (d)Identifier can not have space in the middle of the words. If we need to provide spaces, we must connect by using _. Hence _ is called as Connector symbol. <br>
          (e)Identifier is case sensitive (a!=A) we can create two variables with the name 'a' and 'A'. <br>
          (f)The keyword and reserved words can not be used as an user defined Identifier. But predefined class name, variable name and method name can be used as User defined Identifier.
