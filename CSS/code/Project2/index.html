                    Java is a platform independent multi-paradigm programming language.
                    Note:-Multi-paradigm means it supports multiple styles of
                    Programming.

        <h2>Who invented Java and why ?</h2>
        <article>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Java is invented by Mr.James Gosling in Sun Microsystems in the
              year 1991,and it is released in the year 1995.The version is
              released only for testing purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
              The first version for project development is released in the year
              1996 as java 1.0.The latest version of java is 22,and it is
              released on March 19<sup>th</sup> 2024.
            </li>
            <li>
              Currently java is with Oracle Corporation.In the year 2010,Oracle
              Corporation acquired java and all other products of Sun
              Microsystems.
            </li>
            <li>
                Java is invented to achieve Platform independency for developing internet based business applications.

        <h2>Types of Applications</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
             In computer world all softwares or projects or applications are basically divided into two types:- <br><br>
             <u><b>(i)Stand-alone Application:-</b></u> <br>
              An application that is installed in one system and if it is accessible only within this system with a local call,and can't be accessible from other systems with a network via internet then we call it as Stand-alone application. A stand-alone application is a single user and single computer application.<br>
              For example:-Calculator,Notepad,Antivirus,MS-office,Game softwares,browser,mobile apps etc.. <br> <br>
             <u><b>(ii)Internet Application:- </b></u><br>
             An application that is installed in one system and if it is accessible from other systems with a network via internet is called as Internet Application.
             An internet application is a multi user and multi computer application. <br>
             For example:-Youtube,Instagram,Facebook,Amazon,Zoom etc...

        <h2>What is Platform,PD,PI ?</h2>
        <article>
          <p><b>Platform:- </b><br>
            A platform is an environment in which programs are loaded and executed and generate output. A platform can be a software only platform or hardware only platform or both. <br>
            <ul>
                <li>The computer  platform is Processor+Hardware devices+OS.</li>
                <li>C and C++ programs platform is OS.C and C++ programs are directly exceuted by OS.</li>
                <li>Java Programs platform is JVM(Java Virtual Machine). Java Programs are excuted by JVM,but not by OS. JVM's platform is OS.The OS executes JVM, JVM executes Java Program. </li>
                <li>Python program's platform is PVM(Python Virtual Machine).Python Programs are executed by PVM,but not by OS. PVM's platform is OS. The OS executes PVM, PVM executed Python Program.</li>
                <li>HTML page platform is browser.</li>
                <li>Audio and Video files platform is media player(vlc).</li>
                <li>.NET program platform is CLR(Common Language Runtime). </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
                <p><b>Platform Dependency:-</b> <br>
                    A program's compiled code of one OS,if it can not be executed in different OS we call it as Platform Dependency.The programming language using which we develop this program is called as <b>Platform Dependent Language.</b> <br>
                    For Example:C and C++ programs
                </p>
                <p><b>Platform Independency:-</b> <br>
                    A program's compiled code of one OS, if it can be executed in different OS we call it as Platform Independency.The Programming language using which we develop this program is called as <b>Platform Independent Language.</b> <br>
                    For example:Java,Python Programs

        <h2>Why C and C++ programs are PD ?</h2>
        <article>
        <p>
            In C and C++ languages programs are compiled targeting to one OS. Hence the compiled code contains ML(Machine Language)of a Particular OS directly.One OS machine language format is not understandable to another OS.Hence the C and C++ programs compiled code can not be executed by other OS.Hence the C and C++ programs are Platform Dependent. <br>
            Not only C program, C software is also platform dependent, because all it's components Compiler, Linker & Library are Platform Dependent.So, we will have separate C software for every OS.

            <p>
                In java,programs are not compiled into Machine Language of a Particular OS.It means in Java,Programs are not compiled targeting to one OS.In java,programs are compiled into one common languages code called <b>byte code</b> then later that byte code is converted into ML of a particular OS by JVM in which it is running.We have to separate JVM for OS for converting the same bytecode into a particular OS ML.

        <article>
            <ul>
                <li>JDK stands for Java Development Kit</li> 
                <li>JDK is the java Software <br>
                It provides :- <br>
               (i)Development Tools <br>
               (ii)Runtime Environment <br>
              (iii)Java Library(API-Application Programming Interface)</li>
                <li>Development tools means small softwares for compiling java program, reading byte code, generating documentation, preparing jar files etc... opeartions performing softwares are called Development Tools.
                <br>
                Runtime Environment means the platform for running java program. The JVM is called Runtime Environment of Java Program for executing java programs. <br>
                Java Library means the predefined classes provided by SUN(Oracle) as part of JDK for reusing and developing our new programs. In java we will calls library as API.
                </li>
                <li>Hence we can say by installing JDK software we will get (compiler,JVM and API) for developing,compiling and executing a java program.</li>
                <li>Downloading and installing JDK22 software:-</li>
                (1)Open browser <br>
                (2)Search jdk 22 download <br>
                (3)Click java downloads <br>
                (4)Scroll down ->Click windows <br>
                (5)Click jdk.exe file <br> 
                (6)Downloading will be start <br>
                (7)After Downloading is completed <br>
                (8)Click on jdk.exe file on browser download <br>
                (9)Click yes to give permission to start installing <br>
                (10)Click next in the first window <br>
                (11)Click change in the next window <br>
                (12)And make installing path as "C:\jdk-22\"
                (13)Click Ok ->Next ->Close
                (14)JDK installation is completed in the folder "C:\jdk-22"
                <li>Steps to develop a java program <br>
                a java program development, compilation and execution comes under & steps:-
                (1)Open Notepad <br>
                (2)Type java code/program <br>
                (3)Save this program <br>
                (4)Open cmd prompt software <br>
                (5)Change drive and directory path in cmd prompt to our project drive and directory in which our program is saved.
                (6)Compiler java program by using javac tool.(javac <file name>)
                (7)Execute java byte code by using java tool .(java <class name>)

        <h2>Essential Statements to develop Java</h2>
        <article>
            <p>To develop, compile, execute and display some message in java we have three essential Statements. <br>
            <b>(i)Class :-</b><br>
            Class is essential because, Java is an OOP language so every program must starts with a class. <br>
            <b>(ii)Main method :-</b><br>
            Main method is essential because,main method is the initial point of class logic execution.JVM executes a class starts with main method. If a class doesnot have main method, JVM will not execute it , will throw error. <br>
            <b>(iii)System.out.println(); :-</b> <br>
            System.out.println(); is essential in java. We can display any message on console only by using System.out.println(_);</p>
